# DigitClassifier

Created a digit (integer number) classifer using neural network

I took help from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJhH2cnjD34

I have used MNIST digit library to extract training and tesing data

I implemented Neural Networkk with 3 dense layers. It is a very basic, effective and effecient project to learn what a neural network is.

To classify the image just upload your image at very last cell the model will predict and tell you the output
